# Lockpicking Karate Belt Ranking System

This project was written as a fun game on reddit.com/r/lockpicking. It has since become very popular and represents the work of many dedicated moderators and individuals. You may feel free to use this system for your group or local club, provided you abide by its Creative Commons license.

## Getting Started

Remember that locks are expensive and once a lock is classified, it can be quite impactful to re-classify it. Many folks invest in locks speciffically for the purposes of gaining belts and it's important to consider their investments before reclassifying locks downward.

While a CSV file is provided containing the locks and their classification, this should be considered a downstream representation of the current working list on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QbPqEnGea0HVmo_m8oo06IrX_eVt1ajjuH7hNAzyk2U/edit?usp=sharing).
