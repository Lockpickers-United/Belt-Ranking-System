##Earn Lockpicking Karate Flair

As a way to have fun (perhaps at the expense of Six Sigma) this sub gives its members the opportunity to earn user flair in the form of karate belts. Belt flair is issued based on the accomplishments of the member, with each higher level requiring increased community participation and the picking of increasingly difficult locks.

Karate Belt Flair is entirely optional and members will go "unranked" until they specifically requests ranking by [messaging the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). The moderators do not actively monitor the sub and all requests must go through modmail, posts requesting a belt will be removed. 

Remember this is all just for fun... In the end, no matter what karate belt you wear, you're still just wearing fancy pajamas.

###FAQ

* Question: Must I begin at "White Belt Picker" and progress through the ranks, or can I skip directly to the belt that is appropriate for me?
 * Answer: You can skip directly to the belt that is appropriate for you. Just compile a list of your accomplishments in accordance with the guidelines and request to be issued the belt you are going for.

* Question: My lock is SFIC or some other really difficult to gut core and I don't want to risk ruining it. Can I still use this to qualify for a belt?
 * Answer: For SFIC locks, check the guidelines listed under [SFIC Filming Requirements](#wiki_sfic_filming_requirements). For other locks, maybe. [Let us know what you're thinking](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) and we will try to work with you to find a way of meeting the requirement.

* Question: I don't make lockpicking videos. Can I use a photograph for the higher levels instead?
 * Answer: No. While we understand that people have privacy concerns, the gold standard for Locksport is to video your accomplishments as a way of sharing them with the community. The video does not have to be public and you can remove it as soon as we have reviewed it, but does need to be a video that meets the standards outlined in the "Rules" section. For those not wanting to share public videos, we are suggesting that you use [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) and select the option to password protect your video.

* Question: I already have a Six Sigma black belt. Can I trade this for a lockpicking belt?
 * Answer: No, but you get points for making us LOL :)

* Question: Can I use this belting system for my club or picking group?
 * Answer: Of course. This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Just be sure to credit us.

* Question: Will I be disqualified if I shoot the video vertically?
 * Answer: No, but for the betterment of the world, [please say "no" to vertical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechvhb0Meo).

* Question: What's the deal with the Abus numbering?
 * Answer: Most Abus padlocks have two numbers, for example 55/40.  The first number printed on the lock is the model of lock, and the second number is the width of the lock in millimeters.  Many of the smaller variants of a model lack some of the security features of the larger variants, so we list the minimum size that we will accept for that belt rank.  For example, we list the Abus 55/40, we will also accept the 55/45 and 55/50.  We will not accept smaller variants of the lock listed for that belt rank.  Variants of the Abus locks that are smaller than the size listed can be assumed to be white belt in rank (we may make some exceptions, but a smaller variant will never be accepted as the listed belt rank of a larger variant.)

* Question: I asked for special consideration on something and I don't agree with your decision on the matter.
 * Answer: While we honestly make every effort to be accommodating, it is inevitable that there will be disagreements. Once you have made your case and the decision has been rendered, it's time to respectfully step away. Endlessly trying to convince us of your position is counterproductive and disrespectful. Doing so will result in a warning. If continued, you will be ineligible for promotion for 30 days.

* Question: Are there any more goals to work towards after achieving black belt?
 * Answer: Yep! We have an entirely separate rule system for earning stripes after you've achieved black. It takes into account everything you've done throughout your lockpicking career, so we advise you don't delete any of your videos from the internet. These rules are still somewhat fresh, and will likely be changed quite a bit over time. Check it out [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vlqsVatXKL5Yv-8E0dvkV4tCr3K80ORNWFxJSPFSmBI).

***********************************


###General Rules

- When making your belt request, please add the model of your lock into the request (if you know what it is.)  There are hundreds of different models of lock commonly used around the world, and the mods are not immediately familiar with every single lock.

- We will add your flair, but it's up to you to show it. You must select the option **"show my flair on this subreddit"** in order for your belt ranking to be visible.

- Your accomplishments must be demonstrated on locks that are **NOT IN USE**. Your photographs and videos must clearly show a lock that is not protecting anything.

- Your photographic proof must be clear and in focus. **The plug must be shown in the turned position** with no key in it. Basically in a position it could not otherwise be unless it had been picked.

-  Your video proof must show the lock picked and gutted in one continuous shot with no cuts. The video should be clear, well lit, and the lock should stay in frame at all times. If you have privacy concerns, [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) provides an option to password protect your videos. /u/Kitteh_of_Dovrefjel has [created a great video guide](https://youtu.be/gcekRz-7If8) to explain how to pick and gut your locks on video. Also [please say "no" to vertical video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechvhb0Meo)

- Some of the higher belts require for you to help or mentor others. Be friendly, courteous, and patient with them as you provide advice.

- Some of the higher belts require you to have made a tool. This requirement cannot be met by having used a paper clip, bobby pin or the like. You must actually make a specialized tool.

- The list of locks is a living document. If you believe you have picked a lock that is equivalent to one of those listed in the requirements, [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). We will research the lock and add it to the list.

- If you would like to be initially ranked or believe you have met the requirements for the next rank, compile links that demonstrate your accomplishments and [submit them to the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). We will evaluate them and issue you your new belt. **You do not need to begin at "White Belt Picker"**; send us links to your accomplishments and we will initially rank you at the appropriate level.

- The requirements are cumulative, so **you need not repeat the previous requirements to earn a new belt**. For example, if you are a "Green Belt Picker" you have already demonstrated that you can gut and reassemble locks. You do not need to demonstrate this again when moving up to "Blue Belt Picker".

- Acrylic, cutaways, and other designs of locks that allow you to have a clear view of the inside of the lock will not count any higher than a white belt, even if it's a black-belt level lock.

- The lock picked for belt ranking must be "factory pinned".  Some exceptions can be made as many locks do come from the factory unpinned or zero-bitted, or the lock may come only partially assembled, in which case the pinning of the lock must be typical for that type of lock.  Custom pinned locks and challenge locks will only count as a white belt lock.  Adding security pins to otherwise low ranking locks will not increase the ranking of a lock.

- Kung Fu Panda Clause: In some extremely rare cases, a member's accomplishment will be noteworthy to the point that it changes the state of the art with respect to lock picking. Generally this involves highly complex tool, method and technique that results in a "first time in history" opening of a lock that had long stood as pick proof. Since there is usually no precedent for the work having been accomplished, these cases will be evaluated individually as they arise by the moderation team, and the member ranked at the belt deemed appropriate.

- Padlocks must have the shackle closed for it to count as a belt. Padlock cores must be in the originating bodies to count for a belt, removing the core does not count.

***********************************

###Challenge Lock Requirements

Blue Belt Picker and higher require that you have custom pinned a "Challenge Lock" and shared it with another picker. Preferably this lock will make it into circulation and introduce you to the fun of exchanging locks designed not for security but specifically to defeat picking.  
If for some reason you are unable to fully engage with the larger community of exchange we still encourage you to gain the more in-depth knowledge of how locks function that comes from building your own.  [Speak to a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) about possible alternatives to the challenge lock requirement. Having no interest in building a challenge lock is not grounds for an exception.

A "**Challenge Lock**" is defined as:

A commercially made lock **and working key** that includes **a minimum of SIX modifications by the lock builder**. Number of modifications must **total or exceed SIX** and may include any or all of the following:

* Turned, sculpted or shaped key pins
* Turned, sculpted or shaped driver pins
* Modification to the chambers by threading or counter-milling
* Improvised secondary locking mechanism
* Distinguishing mark engraved into the lock
* Hand cut key

Stipulations:

* Each **"turned, sculpted or shaped" key pin** counts as one modification. Pins must be shaped BY the builder, **removing no less than 15%** of the original material
* Each **"turned, sculpted or shaped" driver pin** counts as one modification. Pins must be shaped BY the builder, **removing no less than 15%** of the original material
* **Pin-in-pin** counts as one "turned, sculpted or shaped" pin per pin modified. Shaping a pin and also making it pin-in-pin does not count as two modifications
* **Chamber threading** counts as one "modification" regardless of the number of chambers augmented
* **Chamber counter-milling** counts as one "modification" regardless of the number of chambers augmented
* Each **improvised secondary locking mechanism** counts as one modification (latches, check pins, etc)
* **"Distinguishing mark" engraved into the lock** counts as one modification (**Simple scratches do not count**. Engraving must be a symbol or mark of the maker)
* **Hand cut key** counts as one “modification”. The key must be cut using hand tools from a blank, and must be a reasonable bitting. Locks made with 0-bitted, or minimally bitted keys do not count. 

***********************************

###SFIC Filming Requirements

SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core) locks can be gutted, but require expensive tools to do so.  Normally, we require any lock that can be gutted, to be gutted in order to be eligible for belt rank, but due to the difficult and expensive, but not impossible to gut nature of the SFIC locks, we've come up with a procedure to show the lock hasn't been modified without gutting the lock.

A video demonstration of the filming requirements for SFIC locks can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foYQswwn5LA&feature=youtu.be).  Here is a [Photo example](http://imgur.com/ZNjHz28) as well.
Thanks to u/stab_in_the_eye for the video demonstration, and thanks to u/Tko5479 for the photo example.

1.  Show the keyway of the lock clearly on the video so we can identify the lock.
2.  Use the Operating key to show that the lock opens up with the use of the Operating key  
NOTE: The lock must remain in frame for the remainder of your video past this point  
3.  If the SFIC lock is currently in a lock body, such as a padlock, use the Control key to remove the core
4.  Use the Operating key to turn the plug 180º and show to the camera that the pins are present through the holes in the bottom of the lock.
5.  You may now put the lock core back into a lock body or vice, but the lock must remain in frame for the remainder of the video.
6.  Pick the lock to both operating and control.

You may pick the lock before showing the lock verification steps above, but the lock must remain in frame for the entirety of the video

###For SFIC locks that do not have keys 

The lock must be picked to both control AND operating in one take, in addition to rule 1 above. Show the control lug is operating as intended (locked not moving, unlocked in control mode moving)

###Confirmed SFIC's with security pins

Since it is not always an option to gut SFIC's for video, the following are SFIC's which are confirmed to meet the security pin requirements as listed in the Brown belt list:

* Mako M2 system



Additionally, the following are sources for other SFIC's who are confirmed to provide locks with the proper pinning for Brown belt:

* Bdtry/Riyame

***********************************

###Homemade tools

A number of disc detainer locks (marked with † on the list) have historically been rated at very high belt ranks on account of the difficulty of creating tools in order to attack them. Creating such tools requires a great amount of skill and knowledge of the locks itself. 

For this reason, such locks are given a higher belt rank when picked with a homemade tool as opposed to a tool that has been specifically designed to pick them. Homemade tools do not need to be made entirely from scratch, and can consist of parts taken from other similar tools. The only requirement is that there be some sort of modification beyond making minor adjustments to the shape of an existing complete tool. 

***********************************

###Locks Scheduled for Reclassification

From time to time we may change the rankings of certain locks.  These changes may be due to refined or new picking techniques making locks that were once difficult to pick, less so, or simply because we've decided they were improperly ranked in the first place.  

If a lock moves up a rank (e.g. from yellow belt to orange belt) that change will take effect immediately.  If you notice a lock you picked last week has been moved up a rank and would now qualify you for a higher belt rank, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) to let us know that you should now be ranked higher.

If a lock moves down a rank (e.g. from orange belt to yellow belt) and you've already picked it, fear not, you've earned that rank, and we have no intention to revoke a belt rank that was well earned.  We also understand that some locks require a significant financial and time investment, and you may have already purchased a lock and started working on it before we announced the lock is being reclassified.  When we move a lock down a rank, we will make every effort to state that we are doing so publicly, and provide an appropriate grace period (generally one month) to allow anyone currently working on that lock to have time to get their accomplishment ranked at the old belt level.

**Planned Changes:**

**Effective Immediately:**

* See Changelog in the Discord for more information on all changes.

####Brown Belt
![](%%brown%%)

You are entering the realm of ultra high-security locks and becoming a pillar of the lockpicking community. You find yourself picking locks that are so difficult tools sometimes don’t even exist to open them, requiring you make your own. Tight keyways, rotating sidebar fingers, telescoping keypins, and countermilling are the norm for you.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

Requirements:

1. Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again
2. Demonstrated history of helping advancing and advanced pickers
3. Have built a ["Challenge Lock"](#wiki_challenge_lock_requirements) and shared it with a fellow picker
4. Have made at least one specialized tool
5. SPP and gut two different locks on this list or similar:

To earn a black belt, world-class picking necessary but not sufficient. Mentoring others is necessary but not sufficient. You must deviate from your comfort zone and complete at least two epic quests of sufficient complexity and difficulty. Black Belt Pickers are extremely rare, and while this system was designed with a degree of levity, earning one is true honor and something to be very very proud of.
