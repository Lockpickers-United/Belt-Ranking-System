## Overview

- Stripes are earned through the acquisition of points.
- When an individual achieves black belt, all of their previous achievements are applied towards their total point value.
- A person’s point value never decreases (except in special circumstances because speaking in absolutes is bad), it only increases as they pass milestones.

## Earning points through skills and community involvement
Picking locks is not the only way to earn points. The continuing to acquire extra skills and contribute to the community will continue to be rewarded after black belt. 

### Skills and projects
Completing a new item from the list of skills and project on the original black belt list. This does not include picking black belt locks: **+35 points**

### Reference documents
Creating a formal reference document which breaks down all the main points of a locks design, operation, and vulnerabilities (assuming no document already exists for that lock): **+25 points**

_Note:_ Additional points might be awarded if your write-up covers a family of similar locks. If a lock is not sufficiently different from one which already has a reference document, points will not be awarded for a new document, and the original should be augmented instead.

### Picking guide
Create a unique or systematic method of picking a type of lock and publish a video or document describing how it works (must have new information). **+10 points**

### Public talk
Create and give a talk at a public event focused on physical security. **+10 points** (per unique talk)

### Complex tool design
Create a complex tool which cannot be constructed using only flat metal stock, and use it to defeat a lock which either requires it, or benefits from its use. **+10 points**

### Distribute tool specs
Create a dedicated tutorial for the construction of that tool or provide and publish detailed specs. **+5 points**

### Exceptionally complex and high quality tool design

The tool is either very complex/precise (Sputnik style, complex DD pick, lots of small moving parts) or be a project meant to refine a tool beyond just being able to pick the lock (ridges to lock into positions, well-engraved labels, etc). **+10 points**

### Unique tool
The tool has novel capabilities which have not been demonstrated in other tools. **+15 points**

### Tool design and distribution

Create a complex tool or set of tools which are developed to a point to where it is actively manufactured and distributed to the greater picking community. This bonus can only be claimed once. **+50 points**

### Significant influence in lockpicking
Fulfill the role of tool development and distribution to an extent that has a significant impact on the lockpicking community. This bonus must be approved by a vote by the current pool of black belts. _Supercedes the tool design and distribution bonus._ **+100 points**

### Cease & Desist
Receive a C&D from a lock company that is upset that you published information about their vulnerabilities. **+25 points**

## Earning points by picking locks

Continuing to attack high-security locks is critical to advancing. This is not simply limited to the black belt list, as many of the locks in the lower ranks are sufficiently unique that the process of picking them remains a learning experience. For this reason, points can be earned by picking lower rank locks in addition to black belt locks.
Additionally, due to the wide range of difficulties within the list of black belt locks, they have been split into 5 levels.
For all locks, the same rules for picking on video apply, except in specific cases where there is a reason for not publicising a method (this rule is for Hux, basically). 

| Belt and Level | Points       |
|----------------|--------------|
| Purple         |  **+2 points** |
| Brown          |  **+4 points** |
| Red            |  **+9 points** |
| Black level 1  | **+18 points** |
| Black level 2  | **+22 points** |
| Black level 3  | **+26 points** |
| Black level 4  | **+30 points** |
| Black level 5  | **+40 points** |

### Point Modifiers
There are special cases in which the point value for a lock is modified to reflect the amount of work and skill that was required to pick it.

__First recorded pick:__ In the event that an individual is the first person to pick a certain lock on video, even if done before the classification of the lock, **x1.5 points**. 
_Note:_ This bonus is awarded at the discretion of the moderators, and does not apply if the lock in question is very similar to a previously picked lock.

__First recorded pick (notable lock):__ Certain locks on the list will be marked with a * which indicates that they are locks that have famously not been picked on video. Being the first to demonstrate a successful pick of a notable lock receives **x2.5 points**

__Non-picking defeat:__ Demonstrating a previously unknown method of defeating a specific lock nondestructively other than picking receives **x0.75 points**.
_Note:_ that creating a new defeat for a lock you have already picked does result in additional points.

__Non-picking defeat (first defeat):__ Demonstrating a non-picking method of defeating a lock which has no known prior defeats receives **x1.5 points** (x2, notable lock), however the lock will still be considered unpicked.

__Picking similar locks:__ Many locks on the list are very similar to each other. As a result, picking a lock which is similar to a previous picked lock takes less effort, and comes with a **penalty**

__Lock groups:__ Some locks on the modified black belt list are assigned a group denoted by colored font. When someone picks a lock from a group they have picked from before, only the highest valued lock picked from that group is awarded full points, and all others receive half. In this way, picking a level 1 black belt lock which is similar to a previously picked lock will only be considered as difficult as picking a red belt lock.

_Example:_
Assa Twin Pro = 18 points
Assa Twin Pro + Assa Twin 6000 (gins) = 0.5 × 18 + 22 = 31 points
Assa Twin Pro + Assa Twin 6000 (gins) + Assa Twin v10 = 0.5 × 18 + 0.5 × 18 + 22 = 40 points

#### Upgraded versions of locks

Some locks are literally the same lock but with different internal modifications, such as the Assa Twin 6000. In these cases, both forms of the lock will be listed at their respective difficulties on the list. If both versions are picked, only the highest value version applies. 

_Example:_ 
Picking Assa Twin 6000 with gins and barrels still only yields 22 points.
